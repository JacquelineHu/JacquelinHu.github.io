  summary: >
    I come from Guangdong, China and I am going to earn my B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
    My major is Biomedical engineering while my research interest focuses on biomedical imaging / radiology, especially MRI. 
    Sequence design, 3D imaging, dynamic imaging are fields that I want to probe into.
    Besides, I'm also interested in image processing, including machine learning, computer-aid diagnoses concerning neural diseases.
    Now I'm looking forward to pursuing my graduate study in biomedical imaging or image processing.
