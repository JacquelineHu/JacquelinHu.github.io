  Introductions and ideas for my graphic design works
tags: Design

## To begin with
I first started to learn Photoshop when I was a freshman in college. I joined the Department of Social Activity in our university and was director of the Center for Design and Publicity. Unexpectedly, graphic design has become so attractive to me that I enjoy myself completely when playing it. I put some of my work here for recording my 3 years' development.

### Winter social activity
<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/blog/winterphoto.jpg" height="400" width="600">
  <p><font size="2">2017.12 寒假社会实践</font></p>
</div>                                                                              

* Theme: Winter Social Activity
* Time: 2017.12
* Style: Oil painting
* Description: A person standing in the winter is holding a photo of his/her group members of summer social activity.
* Ideas: Considering the winter social activity was regarded not as important as that of summer, I added an photo of summer here to indicate the benefit of winter social activity: helping to better prepare for the following summer social activity. Also, the scene of the photo and the background were harmonious in terms of sight and color to make this combination natural.
  
### Recruitment Advertisement
<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/blog/recruiting_poster_trans.jpg" height="400" width="600">
  <p><font size="2">2018.02 英雄招募令</font></p>
</div>             

* Theme: Swordsman
* Time: 2018.02
* Style: Ink painting
* Description: Calling back the swordsman with dragon(talent)
* Ideas: Every department was faced with strong pressure during the recruiting season. Tens of organizations were posting their ads at the same time and same place. I envisioned this unique style of poster could help us stand out. Besides, the exertion of traditional Chinese swordsman imagery could lead people to think of recruitment subconsciously.

### Watertown
<div align="center">

</div>     

* Theme: Chinese Watertown
* Time: 2017.09
* Style: Water painting
* Description: A ripple-textured watertown beneath a fiber-textured sky.
* Ideas: The watertown in south China is such a gorgeous place! Distinctive architecture there is a typical symbol of its beautiful scenery. I used ripple-textured architecture to imply the feature of water. And the sky was covered with fiber to make the picture rich and full as a whole. Can you find out the original material of make the sky was actually a microscope image of cells?
  
### SJTU
<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/blog/watercolor.jpg" height="450" width="300">

</div>     
* Theme: SJTU
* Time: 2017.09
* Style: Oil painting
* Description: SJTU logo + Gragon + Chinese map
* Ideas: This board back ground is a simply combination fo several elements. The most conspicuous one is a logo of "SJTU", which is my university. The dragon behind it is a traditional Chinese totem. The ingenuity of this design work is at the four corns. They are parts of Chinese map shaped by colorful splashing ink.
