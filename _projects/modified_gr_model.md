# Characterizing the evolution of entorhinal cortex in AD patients

## Abstract

Early anatomic change of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) provides us with information about the potential pathological structural deformation due to the Alzheimer’s Disease. To better understand the personalized pathological change in ERC, we first describe a mean deformation trend of ERC over a long period of time as a prior distribution using geodesic regression. Then we modify the basic geodesic regression model to investigate the personalized deviation from the mean deformation trend. The result shows that more atrophy and thickness reduction happen in the ERC in subjects who have mild cognitive impairment than normal population.

## Background

The localized anatomic changes in brain associated with the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is considered as an indirect measurement of neural damage[1]. In particular, the entorhinal cortex is demonstrated a subcortical structure whose atrophy and thickness show a significant relationship with early pathological deformation in patients developing AD[2]. To investigate the deformation of entorhinal cortex at a preclinical stage, we focus on the patients who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) then progressing to AD.

Computational anatomy provides a possible approach to compute the deformation quantitatively. Characterization of atrophy in entorhinal cortex can be reflected by smooth longitudinal mapping, which is also known as diffeomorphism. Diffeomorphometry describes the correspondence and changes between time-varying templates under the premise of smoothness[2]. In this project, we fit in the time-varying entorhinal cortex templates using the method of diffeomorphometry.
  
## Problems
 
People have been trying for years to find out what is happening in our brain due to aging or due to some specific diseases on the top of aging, such as AD[3]. Linear models used to describe the changes in longitudinal brain templates appear to perform well in a short period of time. However, long-term deformation is considered non-linear and anatomically localized. 

Characterizing the mean evolution of brains at a statistic level can be very valuable for the understanding of outliers which may be caused by diseases. Thus, to draw a mean deformation trend of normal brains and observing the deviation of MCI population will help us identify the pathological changes associated with AD at an early stage. In our project, we are trying to characterize the **mean evolution** of normal ERC as a prior distribution and find out **personalized deviation** from the mean to investigate pathological AD-related structural changes.

## Methods

### Overview
We describe the deformation of each subject’s time-varying ERC templates as a continuous smooth trajectory passing from the baseline through each follow up templates. Our approach to quantify the deformation is to measure the **velocity** of the trajectory at each moment. The velocity field generated by a single subject is expected to be 4-dimensional in terms of time and space to adapt to high-dimensional time and regional shape variability. Statistically, we average all subject-dependent velocity fields of normal population according to their birthdays to obtain the mean deformation trend associated with aging. Under the influence of the mean trend, we further identify the deviation of MCI subjects from the mean trend to observe the structural change due to pathology.

### Subjects
The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(adni.loni.usc.edu) has provided us with a bunch of longitudinal MRI brain scans of normal/control subjects and MCI/non-control subjects. Subjects included in this dataset were in their 60s to 70s when scanned. Most of their scans were acquired at 6, 12, and 24 months after the baseline. People have segmented the scans manually to get triangulated entorhinal cortex templates of subjects in each group. Templates have already been rigidly aligned to its baseline then all onto the baseline of one single subject. An example set of templates of one subject is shown in **Fig.1**

### Rigid registration
We only want to measure the non-rigid deformation of the ERC, and thus we apply rigid registration to eliminate the rigid part as much as possible. Each patient's templates were all previously registered to their baseline and all patients' baselines were aligned with a specific baseline. On the top of that, we also optimize some rigid motion parameters including translation and rotation while computing the geodesic trajectories. Since the points in the templates have no one-to-one correspondence over time, our registration is based on **current matching algorithm**[4].

### Geodesic Regression
Even though the consistency of the segmentation can be assured, we cannot avoid the noise while segmenting. Therefore, the segmented templates are not exactly accurate. The problem is that the deformation of the time-varying templates may not be smooth as what it should be in the reality, which means, the shape of the templates may change in opposite directions over time. 

To deal with this problem, we use **geodesic regression** [5] to fit in the time-varying ERC templates. What geodesic regression does is to deform a template over time to match the target templates at each moment but still make sure the deformation remains smooth. Mathematically, we give each vertex of the triangulated ECR templates an initial velocity and have it shot with time. Then a smoothing filter is applied to assure the smoothness of the deformation. And finally, we optimize the initial velocity using machine learning based on declining the difference energy and regularization loss between the deformed templates and the target templates with current matching algorithm [4]. How a deformed template is changing over time to match the original scans is shown in **Fig.2** .

Then we have a trajectory describing a patient's ERC over two years. In order to test the accuracy of the trajectory, we sample it at the time when the original scans were acquired and do comparasion as shown in **Fig.3**.

### Average Velocity fields
Our approach to average the velocity fields is a spatiotemporal statistical processing of the longitudinal data [6]. At each time point, we measure the velocity of each subject i on every vertex and then map the velocity field into a standardized dense grid, in which j stands for every grid point. Our time synchronization is based on the subjects’ birthdays. 

$$ \overline u_j (t) = avg(\sum_{i}{u_{ij}(t)}) $$
