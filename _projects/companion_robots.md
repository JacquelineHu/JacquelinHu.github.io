# Companion Robots for the Elderly

## Background
Aging has become an obvious social problem in China. Survey shows that nearly 50% of the elderly believe that the lack of children's companion is the biggest problem in elderly care. On the other hand, for those young people, living habits, age differences, work pressure and other resons decline their opportunities to communicate with their parents.
