# Welcome to my Blog

I've been trying to trying to write down interesting things in my blog. Here, you can find want I learned, what I thought, and what I did.

As a biomedical engineering student, I'd like to brige engineering and medicine. And I would also like to make technology useful to change the world, and meanwhile easier to understand. I hope you can enjoy it as much as I do!

## Getting started
I may post my blog either in English or in Chinese. This is because on the one hand my classes are sometimes in English so I use English to take notes. On the other hands, I also want my parents and friends can know what I'm writing, so I use Chinese. Ok! Let's get started!
